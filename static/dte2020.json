Consolidating dedicated servers into fewer virtualized units decreases the number of required systems, which can reduce energy consumption. Despite the initial investment costs, the payback period is between one and three years in many cases, and less than one year for some applications.",

Commercial kitchen ventilation hoods are designed to exhaust conditioned air to meet the air exchange demand at full capacity.  Therefore, ventilation hoods with constant airflow fans operate to meet 100% of the design load, even when the kitchen is not running at full capacity.  Kitchen ventilation hoods with demand control reduce the amount of conditioned air that is exhausted from the kitchen when it is not operating full load; reducing the overall HVAC load.  Therefore, we recommend the installation of kitchen ventilation hoods with demand controls to lower the HVAC load in commercial kitchens.&#10;&#10;Demand Control for Commercial Kitchen Hoods are only available for incentives through the DTE Food Service Instant Rebate Program.

      "description": "Due to leaks, among other factors, high-pressure compressed air around 120 psi is typically generated to make sure that the end user receives the compressed air required to maintain production.  Maintaining the system at a higher pressure drives higher energy used by the compressed air system.  Additionally, higher compressed air pressure also increases the losses within the system, as more air is lost through leaks.  Therefore, compressed air pressure flow controllers are highly recommended to reliably lower the compressed air system pressure (within 2% of set point) without compromising production time.  It is estimated that for systems in the 100-psig range, every 2 psi drop in average system pressure could lead to about 1% reduction of the compressor&#8217;s energy usage.  Thus, reducing the compressed air system pressure from 120 to 100 could reduce the compressed air energy usage by about 10%.",

When the compressor runs in load mode, the motor runs to drive the compressor.  During unload mode, the compressor disengages to stop the compressed air generation but the motor continues running.  VFD controls reduce the compressed air generation by lowering the motor speed accordingly to the actual compressed air demand, and this requires less energy during lower compressed air load requirements.

When the compressor runs in load mode, the motor runs to drive the compressor.  During unload mode, the compressor disengages to stop the compressed air generation but the motor continues running.  VFD controls reduce the compressed air generation by lowering the motor speed accordingly to the actual compressed air demand, and this requires less energy during lower compressed air load requirements.  Therefore, we recommend replacing old compressors equipped with load-unload controls with newer and more efficient VFD compressed air systems.",

Consider replacing a heatless desiccant air dryer with a desiccant air dryer that uses a heater to pre-heat the desiccant purge air or with a desiccant air dryer that uses a blower to purge the desiccant material, instead of compressed air. By switching to Heated or Blower Purge Desiccant Air Dryers, there could be a potential savings up to 20%.",

However, a majority of the time, chillers do not operate at full load conditions.  Therefore, controls can be installed to adjust the water temperature to the actual cooling load.  For example, by increasing the water temperature 5 degrees during periods of low flow (low load) it is possible to reduce the annual energy consumption of the chiller by as much as 15 percent.",

O2 Trim Control measures and controls oxygen supplied to the boiler to maintain an air-to-fuel ratio that ensures maximum combustion efficiency and minimum stack heat losses. In addition, for every one percent decrease in excess O2 supplied to the boiler there is a half percent increase in thermal energy efficiency.&#10;&#10;Incentives are also available for adding linkageless boiler controls to existing boilers without boiler oxygen trim controls. Benefits of microprocessor-driven linkageless burner controls include optimized combustion, repeatability, improved safety control, maximum turndown, fuel and energy savings, and reduced emissions.

In high-bay areas (ceiling heights &#62;15 feet), LED fixtures are available to replace incandescent, HID, and fluorescent fixtures. High bay LEDs can reduce lighting energy consumption by up to 50% and can realize even greater savings when combined with control strategies. In addition, you will benefit from the increased lifespan of LEDs in high bays areas where lamps are often less accessible and where maintenance can be costly.",

LEDs function well in cold temperatures, are resilient to vibration, and provide high-quality light; making them particularly well-suited for outdoor, garage, and parking lot applications. The directional nature of LED light sources also limits light pollution and light trespass. Furthermore, combining an outdoor LED fixture with a motion sensor can provide greater energy savings, as well as enhanced security and reduced light pollution. Combined systems could cut your outdoor lighting cost by up to 75% (when switching from a high pressure sodium system).",

Typically, old welding machines with conventional transformers convert incoming line power from 60 Hz 230V, 460V, 575V power to a lower voltage, which is then rectified to get the required DC welding output.  This technology delivers an efficiency between 60% and 70%.  Inverter based welding machines first rectify the incoming power to DC.  Then, the inverter takes the incoming DC power and switches it on/off; generating high-voltage and high-frequency DC power that is later transformed into the low-voltage DC power required for welding.  This newer technology could increase the efficiency of welding processes to about 80%.  In addition to energy savings, the inverter based welding machines are significantly smaller and lighter than conventional models.  We recommend replacing old transformer rectifier power source welders that are close to or past their useful life cycle with inverter based models.",
